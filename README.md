# Web-Design

This challenge involves creating a visualization dashboard website using HTMLS and CSS . 
what is designed is the relationships between the Latitude and other weather factors such as temperature, humidity, wind speed and cloudiness. 
individual pages are created for each plot and a means by which we can navigate between them. These pages will contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations.There is also a home page, that contains comparison of all of the plots, and another page where we can view the data used to build the plots.
